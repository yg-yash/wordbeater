The **Word Beater Game** is an interactive and fun typing game that challenges users to type words quickly as they scroll across the screen. The game includes a countdown timer and a real-time scoring system that tracks words per minute (WPM). The goal is to improve typing speed and accuracy while having fun.

This project is built using **Vanilla JavaScript**, HTML, and CSS, and it is mobile-responsive, providing a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

- **Word Scrolling**: Words scroll across the screen, and the user must type them before they disappear.
- **Countdown Timer**: A countdown timer runs as the user types, adding a sense of urgency.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the current score and tracks your words per minute (WPM).
- **High Score**: Keeps track of the highest score across sessions.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Project Steps

1. **Design and Layout**: Designed the layout using HTML and CSS to create a clean, responsive, and interactive UI.
2. **Game Logic**: Developed the game mechanics using JavaScript, including the timer, word generation, and user input handling.
3. **Graphical Representation**: Added a real-time graph to track and display words per minute (WPM) using Chart.js.
4. **Mobile Compatibility**: Ensured the game is fully responsive for a smooth experience on mobile devices.

## Challenges

- Managing the smooth scrolling of words and ensuring that the game mechanics worked seamlessly without using any external libraries (besides Chart.js).
- Handling real-time user input and game progression with minimal delays to ensure the game remains fast-paced and enjoyable.
